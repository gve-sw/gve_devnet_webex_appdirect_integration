# Webex AppDirect Integration

This demo shows three basic integration workflows between the AppDirect Marketplace and the Webex Partner Hub (Webex Wholesale API). The mentioned workflows are the creation, update and deletion of Webex subscriptions based on the users' interaction with AppDirect. Furthermore, it covers the creation of a new Webex organization, if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

18. Note the entered information for a later step and click **Save**    


**Get Public Url for the Demo Application Tunnel:**   

This app requires being reachable over an internet accessible URL, so that AppDirect can send events to it. Therefore, it can be deployed on different IaaS platforms like Heroku, Amazon Web Services Lambda, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and more. For simplicity, we will use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) here to create a tunnel to our local app. Please be aware that ngrok can be blocked in some corporate networks.  

19. Download and install [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)   
20. Execute the following command in the terminal:   
  ```
  ngrok http 5002
  ```   
> This demo app is running on http://localhost:5002 by default      
21. Copy and save the **Forwarding** URL with the format **https://[xxx].ngrok.io** from the output for the next step   
![/IMAGES/ngrok.png](/IMAGES/ngrok.png)   


**Define the Integration Endpoints:** 

22. On the AppDirect product edit page, click **Edit Integration** in the **INTEGRATION** sections of the left menu 
23. Fill in the following integration endpoints based on the URL from step 21:   
  * Subscription Create Notification URL: https://[xxx].ngrok.io/subscription_receiver?eventUrl={eventUrl}&eventType=create
  * Subscription Change Notification URL: https://[xxx].ngrok.io/subscription_receiver?eventUrl={eventUrl}&eventType=update
  * Subscription Cancel Notification URL https://[xxx].ngrok.io/subscription_receiver?eventUrl={eventUrl}&eventType=cancel
  > Note: Adapt the [xxx] section accordingly 
24. Click **Save**   


## Prepare the Webex Partner Hub 

**Create a Configuration Template:**   

Go to the Webex Partner Hub (https://admin.webex.com/),   
25. Click **Customers** in left menu > **Templates** Tab > **Create template**      
26. Provide the following information:
  * Template name
  * Country or region (e.g. United States of America)
  * Service provider admin
  * Cloud Connected PSTN provider (requirement for the provisioning of Webex Calling)
  * You do not need to select a wholesale subscription    
27. Click **Next**
28. Choose the applicable authentication and click **Next**
29. Define the **Brand name for emails** and click **Next**
30. Review the provided information and click **Submit**
31. Click the name of the template that you just created in the list > copy the **Provisioning ID** for a later step as shown below:   
![/IMAGES/template_008_provisionId.png](/IMAGES/template_008_provisionId.png)   


## Get a Webex Token
  
32. Navigate to https://developer.webex.com   
33. Log in with the same account you used with the Webex Partner Hub.   
34. Navigate to an API endpoint such as https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/wholesale-subscribers/list-wholesale-subscribers   
35. In the **Try It** Tab > select **Use personal access token** > copy the bearer token and save it for a later step.  
![/IMAGES/webex_api_bearer.png](/IMAGES/webex_api_bearer.png) 

> **Note:** A personal access token is a short-lived access token you can use to make Webex API calls on your own behalf. Any actions taken through the API will be done as you. Personal access tokens expire 12 hours after you sign in to the Developer Portal and should not be used in production environments. A production app should instead create an [integration](https://developer.webex.com/docs/integrations) to obtain an access token from an authenticating user using OAuth.  


## Installation/Configuration of the Sample App

36. Make sure you have [Python 3.8.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.

## Usage

**Create a Subscription**   

Start your integration tests in AppDirect by creating a subscription,  

44. Go to **Manage** > **Developer** > click **Edit** next to the previously created product > click **Integration Report** (in the **INTEGRATION** section) > click **Run Test** in the **Subscribe to your product** section.      
45. Choose a subscription and click **Create Subscription**      
46. If the Webex organization associated to the users' AppDirect company doesn't exist already, it will be automatically created as part of the process. This provisioning process can take up to 5 minutes. Thereby, the user will be notified that a set-up process was triggered, and asked to wait for around 5 minutes. **This only happens once for each company in AppDirect, when the first user buys a subscription. For every following user of the company, step 46 will be skipped.**     
47. After 5 minutes, the user can click **Create Subscription** again. This time the Webex organization is present and the subscriber will be added to the available organization.       


**Updating a Subscription.**  

48. Click **Continue to Change**   
49. Choose another subscription and click **Change Subscription**   


**Cancelling a Subscription.** 

50. Click **Continue to Cancel**   
51. Choose another subscription and click **Cancel Subscription**

## Limitations

This sample code only shows some basic integration workflows for the packages: Webex Meetings, Webex Calling, Webex Suite. It is not meant to cover all possible workflows or configurations. Some of the information required for the creation of the Webex organization and subscribers is static, since we assume that the information is provided by an additional external system, which is not part of this demo.
For simplicity, this demo assigns random phone extensions when adding a Webex Calling or Suite subscription instead of a phone number.
